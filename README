Buffered Ext.List for Sencha Touch 2
====================================

An enhanced Ext.List which should be able to handle large(ish) lists (1000+
items) by limiting the number of rendered items using a sliding-window
approach.

Based on 'BufList PR3 - pre release' by MahlerFreak:

Make sure you symlink 'touch' to the location of the Sencha Touch 2 SDK, so
the relevant .js and .css can be found.

WORK IN PROGRESS!
